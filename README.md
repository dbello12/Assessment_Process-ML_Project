## Assessment_Process-ML_Project

These are the files for my project on the assessment process ML model

### 1. Data (not included here for confidentiality reasons)
The data consists of the survey responses of approximately 1,060 potential candidates between 2019 and 2022. There are about 270 columns containing:

- Personal and contact information of the candidate and spouse
- Results of the DISC Personality and Prepare-Enrich Marriage tests (categorical variables)
- Results of the Initial Assessment survey. This is a survey that the candidate, his wife, and six observers take on the areas of character, leadership, multiplication, and vision.  Each area has 10 to 13 sub-areas and all of the responses range from 0 to 100.
- Binary Responses from observes to 20 questions on “Threats & Challenges” to the candidate. Scores range from 0 to 6.

The models will be presented in three datasets:
- Dataset 1 contains the top 50 features, which will be selected using Random Forest Feature Importance
- Dataset 2 is another data subset selected as a result of statistical analysis
- Dataset 3 is the entire dataset.
